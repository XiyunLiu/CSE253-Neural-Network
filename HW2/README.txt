The code is saved in .ipynb as well as .py.
To run the code, you can just run the .ipynb one cell by one cell.
The data is from MNIST.

The neural network is implemented in the class MNISTClassification.
Build an object from the class. And then call the function fit to train the neural network model. There input parameters that can be changed are the size of the minibatch, the learning rate, the T in the expression of the learning rate, the number of nodes in the hidden layer, the number of hidden layers, the type of regularization with lambda and optimizing.

After training the data, you can just call plotUpdate function to plot out the result.

There is also a part of shuffling the data. After run the cell and then you can do the same thing as above.
